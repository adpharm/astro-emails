# Astro emails

Using Astro to build emails.

- Todo:
  - [ ] **Make builds faster**
    - How can we build just the file that changed? We currently build & transform the entire `pages/` and `dist/` directory.
  - [ ] Build out Astro components
    - [ ] Link
    - [ ] Text
    - [ ] Image
    - [ ] Divider (Hr)
    - [x] IfOutlook/IfNotOutlook
    - [x] Spacer
    - [x] Div
    - [x] Row
    - [x] Col
    - [x] ~~Button/Clickable~~ (not applicable in email)
  - [ ] Build an email!
  - [ ] Auto-VML - i.e. no components, all done behind the scenes.
    - Ref: https://maizzle.com/docs/components/vml
  - [ ] Can I use [`postcss-preset-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env) for emails?
  - [ ] Images get clipped by Gmail at 102kb. We should warn ourselves!
  - [ ] Report astro bug: having a JSX comment i.e. `{/* @ts-expect-error sdjf */}` ahead of `<html>` causes the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to be removed during build.
- Maybe:
  - [ ] Base URL (for images, etc.). See https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/base-url
  - [ ] URL parameters (for tracking, etc.). See https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/url-parameters
  - [ ] Widow words could be useful. See https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/widows
  - [ ] Batch replace strings in files? See https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/replace-strings
- Done:
  - [x] Astro integration + Vite plugin combo
  - [x] Remove unused CSS (for minification). See https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/remove-unused-css
  - [x] HTML minify - Astro does some for us so... needed? I'm putting it in anyway.
  - [x] Create "Safe class names" (ex. replacing `:`)
    - Refs: https://maizzle.com/docs/transformers/safe-class-names
